AMPMTime
========
A Movable Type plugin that transforms the time custom field in Movable Type's backend into a dropdown with AM/PM selection

Requirements
------------
* Movable Type (Pro version, the plugin works on Custom Fields, a feature lacking from the Open Source version)
* This plugin has been tested on MT4.37 and on MT5.2.6.

Installation
-------------
Drop the AMPMTime folder and its contents into Movable Type's 'plugins' folder.

Usage
------
Any DateTime custom field in the MT backend should now show up as three dropdown menus, one for hours, minutes and am/pm selection.

Credits
--------
This plugin borrows heavily from Dan Wolfgang's HotDate (http://eatdrinksleepmovabletype.com/plugins/hot_date/) plugin.
